Compilation instructions for QStat
----------------------------------

FIXME: the instructions are obsolete

WINDOWS
-------
Windows users can find a pre-built binary in the win32/ directory
of the QStat zip file.  If you need to compile a new Windows binary,
run (requires an Microsoft C/C++ compiler):

nmake windows

UNIX
----
You will need a C compiler and a make utility to compile qstat.

Two makefiles are available for qstat.  If you have GNU make, then
just running it should compile qstat on your platform.  If you are
on Linux, then 'make' is probably GNU make.  On other platforms
it's probably called 'gmake'.  The GNU make compile is controlled
by the GNUmakefile.  Modify it if you need extra flags to compile
on your platform.  If you need to modify the GNUmakefile, let me know
and I'll integrate your changes into the next release.

The GNUmakefile will allow you to set the sysconfdir at compile time.
The command is:
	gmake SYSCONFDIR=config-directory
The default sysconfdir is /etc.  The sysconfdir determines where
QStat will look for a configuration file.  See qstatdoc.html for
more about QStat config files.

If you do not have GNU make, then you'll be using some older form
of make.  There is a Makefile for available for older make, but
you need to tell it what operating system you are using:

	make <operating system>

Instructions for VMS can be found at the end of this file.

The supported operating systems are in the Makefile:

solaris		Sun Solaris 2.4, 2.5, 2.6
sgi irix	SGI Irix 5.3, 6.4
freebsd		FreeBSD
openbsd		OpenBSD
linux		Linux
windows		Windows 95/NT using Microsoft compiler
os2		OS/2 Warp using IBM Visual Age compiler
os2emx		OS/2 Warp using EMX compiler
hp		HP-UX 10.20 and 11.0 using their ANSI C compiler
aix		AIX 4.2
osx		Macintosh OSX (Darwin)

If your system uses GNU cc, edit the Makefile appropriately, or run

make CC=gcc <operating system>

If it doesn't compile for you, try tweaking the library settings
in the Makefile.  If your version of Unix is not listed, try freebsd.
On most Unixes, this should be enough to compile qstat:

cc -o qstat qstat.c hcache.c template.c config.c

As a last resort, send me email and I'll try to help.

Instructions for VMS
--------------------
VMS patches by John Ross Hunt (bigboote@ais.net) Tested with DEC C
V5.6-003 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1

It was tested with DEC C V5.6-003 on OpenVMS Alpha V7.1.  It should
work on OpenVMS Alpha V7.0.  OpenVMS V6.2 and below doesn't support
"h_errno" so you will have to comment out the affected chunks of code.
I have no idea if will work on OpenVMS VAX.

$ cc/prefix=all/standard=vaxc qstat
$ link qstat
$ qstat :== $'f$environ("default")'qstat.exe
$ qstat "-P" "-qws" 38.241.43.118:27910

Note: Use quotes to preserve case in the command line switches.
